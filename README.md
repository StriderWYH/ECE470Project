# ECE470Project
This README is for project update 2.

We modify the code from lab2 as the start code of our project. The source folder contains .py files for the ROS. 
The outline of our project is :
	Simulate the work of Cargo truck handling. Use the camera to detect whether the car is in the range of workspace and stops by, and then drive the robot arm to grip the block and put it on to the car.

The stage we are on now:
	1. Succeed moving the arm with inverse kinematics.
	2. Suceed having access to the gripper, the camera as well as being able to drive the car.
	3. Suceed detecting the car's motion with OpenCV.
	4. Secceed driving the arm to grip the blocks which are spawned randomly and put a block on to the car

For demonstartion, we also provide a video on Youtube https://youtu.be/JxrNKrJEmUU
